    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Marie Antoinette, but you can call me Net for short.
    <br>I just turned 19, and I live in Taguig City.
    <br>I am also a freshman at PUP Main, so I still have a lot to learn in terms of programming. That's why I'm excited to learn with you all!
    <br>I hope to get along with everyoneee‚ù§</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I probably spend the most of my free time playing mobile games and reading.
    <br>I also occasionally watch anime and looove manga, manhuas, and manhwas.
    <br>Roblox, Free Fire, and ML are some of the games I play.
    <br>However, I believe that playing with my three furbabies remains my favorite pastime.</p>
    <h4>Likes & Dislikes</h4>
    <p>I am an ultimate dog lover, but I also like cats and any other cute animals.
    <br>I do enjoy spicy foods and fruits, particularly mangoes.
    <br>Pink and yellow are my favorite colors, so naturally, sunflowers and pink roses are my favorite flowers. 
    <br>Cockroaches are probably the only thing I genuinely hate.</p>
